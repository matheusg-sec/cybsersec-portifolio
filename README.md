# 👋 Hi, I'm Matheus — Cybersecurity Analyst in Training

## 🧭 About Me

I'm a 20-year-old Brazilian living in Portugal, working full-time while transitioning into cybersecurity.

I come from a working-class background and have always believed that knowledge is the path to freedom. Two months ago I started studying cybersecurity seriously — and I haven't stopped since.

My focus is **Blue Team / SOC Analysis**. I'm drawn to the detective side of security: understanding how attacks happen, reading the evidence, and telling the full story of what occurred.

I study every day after work and dedicate my Saturdays to hands-on practice in my Kali Linux lab environment.
